# xDrip-Pebble-E

My Pebble xDrip watchface:

* Simple layout with time of day, blood glucose, big glucose graph, and not much else
* Only tested on the 2025 Pebble 2 Duo, but should be easy to adapt to other Pebbles (PRs welcome!)
* For offline use, just CGM->phone->watch, no internet connectivity.
* Based on the "Pebble Classic Trend Watchface" bundled in xDrip (see below)

## Installation

* Install xDrip
    * At least [2025.12.07](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases/tag/2025.12.07) to make it run
    * Or [my fork](https://github.com/mortenfyhn/xDrip) for full compatibility (big graph, and graph tweaks)
* Enable Pebble integration in xDrip
* Select "Pebble Classic Trend Watchface", say no to the install prompt
* Enable:
    * Display Trend
    * Display Low Line
    * Display High Line
    * Display Slope Arrows
* [Build and install the watchface](https://developer.rebble.io/sdk/)
    * Turn on "Use LAN developer connection" in Pebble app settings
    * Turn on "Dev Connection" in the Pebble app settings for your watch
    * `pebble build`
    * `pebble install --phone IP`

## Emulator

Testing layout changes is much faster with the emulator:

```sh
pebble build
pebble install --emulator diorite
```

Seems platform `flint` (new Pebble 2 Duo) isn't supported by the emulator yet but `diorite` (older Pebble 2) is pretty much the same.

## Repo landscape
